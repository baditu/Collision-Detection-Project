# Collision-Detection-Project

Collision detection is an essential part of everything that modern games mean. In this project, we propose to implement a mechanism for detecting collisions between various shapes.

Technologies used:
-------------------------
- Python
- Pycharm
- basic geometry

How the project work?
---------------------------
We will work with different geometric shapes, like: circle, square rectangle, triangle. Each of the mentioned figures will be framed by a circle (except the circle), which will help us in collision detection. When we initialize the program, we will receive a workspace in which geometric figures can be placed. Any geometric figure with the center outside this space will be ignored. Some featureas:
- calculating the circle that frames a specific figure;
- collision detection with other objects;
- semi-inclusion detection (For example, a circle c1 is semi-included by the circle c2 if c1 is in collision with circle c2 and radius c1 is strictly smaller than radius c2);
